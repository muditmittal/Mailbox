Codepath Week 3 assignment

Although this assignment was pretty straightforward after doing the lab. But I spent some more time playing with the animation sequencing and order.
It took about 10+ hours to complete this assignment.

Actions covered in this submission:
- User can Pan message left or right and based on position:
  - the icons show up, change opacity, change positions, swap to other icons
  - background color changes
  - message either snaps back to original position, or to other corner of the screen
- When message disappears, the view scrolls up
- After a 2 second delay, the message reappears so that you can try other scenarios of the project
- User can Pan on the menu icon and the menu slides and anchors to the right corner
- Tapping on the menu makes it disappear and the inbox comes back to original position
- Added segment control, but did not implement the left and right inboxes.
- Panning from Edge implemented.
